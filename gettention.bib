  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Annotating cell types on the basis of single-cell RNA-seq data is a prerequisite for research on disease progress and tumour microenvironments. Here we show that existing annotation methods typically suffer from a lack of curated marker gene lists, improper handling of batch effects and difficulty in leveraging the latent gene–gene interaction information, impairing their generalization and robustness. We developed a pretrained deep neural network-based model, single-cell bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (scBERT), to overcome the challenges. Following BERT’s approach to pretraining and fine-tuning, scBERT attains a general understanding of gene–gene interactions by being pretrained on huge amounts of unlabelled scRNA-seq data; it is then transferred to the cell type annotation task of unseen and user-specific scRNA-seq data for supervised fine-tuning. Extensive and rigorous benchmark studies validated the superior performance of scBERT on cell type annotation, novel cell type discovery, robustness to batch effects and model interpretability.},
